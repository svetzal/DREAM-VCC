| Input Voltage               | $V_{IN}$  | -0.3 to +7.0   | V                                        |
| Operating Temperature Range | $T_A$     | $T_L$ to $T_H$ | °C (MC6821, MC68B21, MC68B21C, MC68B21C) |

This device contains circuitry to protect the inputs against damage due to high static voltage or electric fields; however, it is advised that normal precautions be taken to avoid applications of any voltage higher than maximum rated voltage to the high impedance circuit. For proper operation it is recommended that $V\_{IN}$ and $V\_{OUT}$ be constrained to the range GND ≤ $V\_{IN}$ or $V\_{OUT}$ ≤ $V\_{CC}$. Unused inputs must always be tied to an appropriate logic voltage level (e.g., either GND or $V\_{CC}$).

## THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS

| Characteristics    | Symbol        |   Value | Unit           |
|--------------------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| Thermal Resistance | $\theta_{JA}$ |      50 | °C/W (Ceramic) |
| Thermal Resistance | $\theta_{JA}$ |     100 | °C/W (Plastic) |
| Thermal Resistance | $\theta_{JA}$ |      60 | °C/W (Ceramic) |

## POWER CONSIDERATIONS

The average chip-junction temperature, $T\_J$, in °C can be obtained from:

$$ T\_J = T\_A + (P\_D \cdot \theta\_{JA}) \tag{1} $$

Where:

- $T\_A$ = Ambient Temperature, °C
- $\theta\_{JA}$ = Package Thermal Resistance, Junction-to-Ambient, °C/W
- $P\_D$ = $P\_{INT}$ + $P\_{PORT}$
- $P\_{INT}$ = $V\_{CC} \cdot V\_{CC}$ * Watts – Chip Internal Power
- $P\_{PORT}$ = Port Power Dissipation, Watts – User Determined

For most applications $P\_{PORT}$ and can be neglected. $P\_{PORT}$ may become significant if the device is configured to drive Darlington bases or sink LED loads.

An approximate relationship between $P\_D$ and $T\_J$ if $P\_{PORT}$ is neglected is:

PB6-PB7 will be read properly from those lines programmed as outputs even if the voltages are below 2.0 volts for a 'high' or above 0.8 V for a 'low'. As outputs, these lines are compatible with standard TTL and may also be used as a source of at least 1 milliamp at 1.5 volts to directly drive the base of a transistor switch.

**Interrupt Input (CA1 and CB1)** — Peripheral input lines CA1 and CB1 are input only lines that set the interrupt flags at the control registers. The active transition for these signals is also programmed by the two control registers.

**Peripheral Control (CA2)** — The peripheral control line CA2 can be programmed to act as an interrupt input or as a peripheral control output. As an output, this line is compatible with standard TTL; as an input the internal pullup resistor on this line represents 1.5 standard TTL loads. The function of this signal is programmed with Control Register A.

**Peripheral Control (CB2)** — Peripheral Control line CB2 may also be programmed to act as an interrupt input or peripheral control output. As an input, this line has high input impedance and is compatible with standard TTL. As an output it is compatible with standard TTL and may also be used as a source of up to 1 milliamp at 1.5 volts to directly drive the base of a transistor switch. This line is programmed by Control Register B.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

**INITIALIZATION** A RESET has the effect of zeroing all PIA registers. This will set PAG-PA7, PB6-PB7, CA2 and CB2 as inputs, and all interrupts disabled. The PIA must be configured during the restart program that follows the reset. There are six locations within the PIA accessible to the MPU data bus: two Peripheral Registers, two Control Registers, and two Control Registers. Selection of these locations is controlled by the RSD and RS1 inputs together with bit 2 in the Control Register, as shown in Table 1. Details of possible configurations of the Data Direction and Control Register are shown in Figure 18.

**TABLE 1 - INTERNAL ADDRESSING**

|   Control Register Bit | R5   | R50   | R51   | Location Selected         |
|------------------------|------|-------|-------|---------------------------|
|                      0 | 0    | 0     | 0     | Peripheral Register A     |
|                      0 | 0    | 0     | 1     | Peripheral Register B     |
|                      0 | 0    | 1     | 0     | Data Direction Register A |
|                      0 | 0    | 1     | 1     | Data Direction Register B |

*X = Don't care*

**PORT A-B HARDWARE CHARACTERISTICS** As shown in Figure 17, the MC8621 has a pair of I/O ports whose characteristics differ greatly. The A port is designed to drive CMOS logic to normal 30% to 70% levels, and incorporates an internal pullup device that remains connected even in the input mode. This allows the A port to drive more than one CMOS load without external resistors. The B side can drive extra loads such as Darlington transistors without problem. When the PIA comes out of reset, the A port represents inputs with pullup resistors, whereas the B side (input mode also) will float high or low, depending upon the load connected to it.

Notice the differences between a Port A and Port B read operation when in the output mode. When reading Port A, the actual pin is read, whereas the B side read comes from an output latch, ahead of the actual pin.

**CONTROL REGISTERS (CRA and CRB)** The two Control Registers (CRA and CRB) allow the MPU to control the operation of the four peripheral control lines CA1, CA2, CB1, and CB2. In addition, they allow the MPU to enable the interrupt lines and monitor the status of the interrupt flags. Bits 0 through 5 of the two registers may be written or read by the MPU when the proper chip select and register select signals are applied. Bits 6 and 7 of the two registers are read only and are modified by external interrupts occurring on control lines CA1, CA2, CB1, or CB2. The format of the control words is shown in Figure 18.

**DATA DIRECTION ACCESS CONTROL (BIT CRA-2 and CRB-2)** Bit 2, in each Control Register (CRA and CRB), determines selection of either a Peripheral Output Register or the corresponding Data Direction E Register when the proper register select signals are applied to RSD and RS1. A '1' in bit 2 allows access of the Peripheral Interface Register, while a '0' causes the Data Direction Register to be addressed.

**Interrupt Flags (CA6, CRA-7, CRB-6, and CRB-7)** — The four interrupt flags are set by active transitions of signals on the four interrupt lines. Peripheral Control lines when those lines are programmed to be inputs. These bits cannot be set directly from the MPU Data Bus and are reset indirectly by a Reset Peripheral Data Operation on the appropriate section.

**Control of CA2 and CB2 Peripheral Control Lines (CRA-3, CRA-4, CRA-5, CRB-3, CRB-4, and CRB-5)** — Bits 3, 4, and 5 of CRA and CRB determine the control of the CA2 and CB2 Peripheral Control lines. These bits determine if the control lines will be an interrupt input or an output control signal. If CRA-5 (CRB-5) is low, CA2 (CB2) is an interrupt input line similar to CA1 (CB1). When CRA-5 (CRB-5) is high, CA2 (CB2) becomes an output signal that may be used to control peripheral inputs transfers. When in the output mode, CA2 and CB2 have slightly different loading characteristics.

Control of CA1 and CB1 Interrupt Input Lines (CRA-0, CRB-0, CRA-1, and CRB-1) – The two lowest-order bits of the control registers are used to control the interrupt input lines CA1 and CB1. Bits CRA-0 and CRB-0 are used to enable the MPU interrupt signals IRQA and IRQB, respectively. Bits CRA-1 and CRB-1 determine the active transition of the interrupt input signals CA1 and CB1.

## Determine Active CA1 (CB1) transition for Setting Interrupt Flag (IRQAIB1) – (bit 7)

- b1=0: IRQAIB1 set by high-to-low transition on CA1 (CB1)
- b1=1: IRQAIB1 set by low-to-high transition on CA1 (CB1)

## IRQAIB1 Interrupt Flag (bit 7)

- Goes high on active transition of CA1 (CB1); Automatically cleared by MPU Read of Output Register AIB1. May also be cleared by hardware Reset.

## Control Register Bit Assignments

| Bit   | Function          |
|-------|-------------------|
| b7    | IRQAIB1 Flag      |
| b6    | IRQAIB2 Flag      |
| b5    | CA2 (CB2) Control |
| b4    | CA2 (CB2) Control |
| b3    | DDR Access        |
| b2    | CA1 (CB) Control  |
| b1    | CA1 (CB) Control  |
| b0    | CA1 (CB) Control  |

## CA1 (CB) Interrupt Request Enable/Disable

- b0=0: Disables IRQAIB1 MPU Interrupt by CA1 (CB1) active transition.
- b0=1: Enable IRQAIB1 MPU Interrupt by CA1 (CB1) active transition.
        1. IRQAIB1 will occur on next (MPU generated) positive transition of b0 if CA1 (CB1) active transition occurred while interrupt was disabled.

## Determines Whether Data Direction Register Or Output Register Is Addressed

- b2=0: Data Direction Register selected.
- b2=1: Output Register selected.

## IRQAIB2 Interrupt Flag (bit 6)

- When CA2 (CB2) is an input, IRQAIB2 goes high on active transition CA2 (CB2); Automatically cleared by MPU Read of Output Register AIB2. May also be cleared by hardware Reset.
- CA2 (CB2) Established as Output (b5=1: IRQAIB2 Z=0, not affected by CA2 (CB2) transitions).

## CA2 (CB2) Established as Output b5=1

- Note: If operation of CA2 and CB2 output functions are not identical.
- b5=1: CA2 goes low on first high-to-low E transition following an MPU read of Output Register A; returned high by next active CA1 transition, as specified by b1.
- b5=0:
    - Read Stroke with CA1 Restore
        - CA2 goes low on first high-to-low E transition following an MPU read of Output Register A; returned high by next active CA1 transition, as specified by b1.
    - b3=1: Read Stroke with CA1 Restore
        - CA2 goes low on first high-to-low E transition following an MPU read of Output Register A; returned high by next high-to-low E transition during a deselect.
    - b3=0: Write Stroke with CB1 Restore
        - CB2 goes low on first high-to-low E transition following an MPU read of Output Register B; returned high by next active CA1 transition as specified by b1. CRB-b7 must first be cleared by a read of data.
    - b3=1: Write Stroke with E Restore
        - CB2 goes low on first high-to-low E transition following an MPU write into Output Register B; returned high by next low-to-high E transition following an on E pulse which occurred while the port was deselected.
- b5 b4 b3:
    - 0 1 0: CA2
    - 0 1 1: CA2
    - 1 0 0: CA2
    - 1 0 1: CA2
    - 1 1 0: CB2
    - 1 1 1: CB2
- Set/Reset CA2 (CB2)
    - CA2 (CB2) goes low as MPU writes b3=0 into Control Register.
    - CA2 (CB2) goes high as MPU writes b3=1 into Control Register.

## CA2 (CB2) Established as Input b5=0

- CA2 (CB2) Interrupt Request Enable/Disable
    - b3=0: Disables IRQAIB2 MPU Interrupt by CA2 (CB2) active transition.
    - b3=1: Enables IRQAIB2 MPU Interrupt by CA2 (CB2) active transition.
        - *IRQAIB2 will occur on next (MPU generated) positive transition of b3 if CA2 (CB2) active transition occurred while interrupt was disabled.
- Determines Active CA2 (CB2) Transition for Setting Interrupt Flag (IRQAIB2) – (bit 6)
    - b4=0: IRQAIB2 set by high-to-low transition on CA2 (CB2).
    - b4=1: IRQAIB2 set by low-to-high transition on CA2 (CB2).
